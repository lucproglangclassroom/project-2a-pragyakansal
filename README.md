# Overview

Examples of using Scala iterators to implement efficient Unix-style filters.

# Objectives

An understanding of

- stream processing (finite vs. infinite/unbounded)
- pipes and filters architecture
- representing streams using the Iterator design pattern
- immutability
- separation of processing and I/O concerns
- testability using the Observer design pattern
- time/space complexity and scalability
- performance benchmarking

# Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) through your package management system or from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads)
- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

These really are the only required prerequisites.

# Running the tests

This will run the unit tests.

    $ sbt test

# Running the sample applications

During development:

    $ sbt run

Or choose one of the following:

    $ sbt 'runMain imperative.simple.LineCount'
    $ sbt 'runMain imperative.modular.CumulativeLength'
    ...

During production, first create the startup scripts:

    $ sbt stage

Then run the filters outside of sbt like this:

    $ ./target/universal/stage/bin/line-count-imperative
    hello
    (1,hello)
    world
    (2,world)
    what
    (3,what)
    up
    (4,up)

    $ yes hello | head -n 4 | ./target/universal/stage/bin/line-count-imperative
    (1,hello)
    (2,hello)
    (3,hello)
    (4,hello)

    $ ./target/universal/stage/bin/cumulative-length-imperative
    hello
    (5,hello)
    world
    (10,world)
    what
    (14,what)
    up
    (16,up)

    $ yes hello | head -n 4 | ./target/universal/stage/bin/cumulative-length-imperative
    (5,hello)
    (10,hello)
    (15,hello)
    (20,hello)

# Running the benchmarks

The benchmarks enable us to compare the performance of the imperative and functional implementations
of the cumulative line length example. For example, you can run them like this:

    sbt "Jmh / run -bm avgt -tu us -w 1 -wi 3 -r 1 -f 1 -t 1"

To see what these options mean, run

    sbt "Jmh / run -h"
